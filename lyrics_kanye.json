I was stayin in Chicago, I had my own apartment, I be doin like, just beats for local acts just to try to keep the lights on, and then to go out and buy, get a Pelle Pelle off lay-away, get some Jordans or something or get a TechnoMarine, that's what we wore back then\nI made this one beat where I sped up this Harold Melvin sample I played it for Hip over the phone, he's like, \"Oh, yo that shit is crazy Jay might want it for this compilation album he doin, called The Dynasty.

I appreciated what they did for me but, you know there's a time in every man's life where he gotta make a change. Try to move up to the next level.

But it was supposed to really go through my production company, but he ended up going straight with the company. So, like I'm just straight holdin' the phone, gettin' the bad news that dude was tryin' to leave my company. And I got evicted at the same time. So I went down and tracked the beats from him, I took that money, came back, packed all my shit up in a U-Haul, maybe about ten days before I had to actually get out so I ain't have to deal with the landlord cause he's a jerk.

And Hiphop said, \"Yo play that one beat for him.\" And I played \"Heart of the City.\" And really I made \"Heart of the City,\" I really wanted to give that beat to DMX\n\n"], "\"No I think Jay gon' like this one right here\"": ["\n\nAnd I played another beat, and I played another beat. And I remember that Gucci bucket, he took it and like put it over his face and made one of them faces like 'OOOOOOOOOOH.' Two days later I'm in Baseline and I seen Dame. Dame didn't know who I was and I was like, \"Yo what's up I'm Kanye.\"\n\n"], "\"Yo, you that kid, Kanye?\"": ["\n\n\"You that kid that gave all them beats to Jay? Yo, this nigga got classics to your beats\"\n\n"], "\"Jay got classics, G.\"": ["\n\nYou know I ain't talkin shit. I'm like \"oh shit.\" And all this time I'm starstruck, man. I'm still thinking 'bout, you know I'm picturing these niggas on the show, The Streets is Watching, I'm lookin, these were superstars in my eyes. And they still are, you know. So, Jay came in and he spit all these songs like in one day, and in two days... I gotta bring up one thing, you know, come back to the story, the day I did the 'Can't be Life' beat on track, I remember Lenny S, he had some Louis Vuitton sneakers on, he think he fly. And Hip Hop was there, I think Ty-Ty, John Meneilly, a bunch of people. I didn't know all these people at the time they was in the room, and I said, \"yo Jay I could rap.\" And I spit this rap that said, uh \"I'm killin y'all niggas on that lyrical shit. Mayonnaise colored Benz, I push miracle whips.\" And I saw his eyes light up when I said that line. But you know the rest, the rap was like real wack and shit, so that's all the response. He said \"man that was tight.\"\n\n"], "\"That, that was cool. That was hot.\"": ["\n\nThat was it. You know, I ain't get no deal then, hehe. Okay, fast forward. So, Blueprint, \"H to the Izzo,\" my first hit single. And I just took that proudly, built relationships with people. My relationship with Kweli I think was one of the best ones to ever happen to my career as a rapper. Because, you know, of course later he allowed me to go on tour with him. Man, I appre-- I love him for that. And at this time, you know I didn't have a deal, I had songs, and I had relationships with all these A&R's, and they wanted beats from me, so they'd call me up, I'd play them some beats. \"Gimme a beat that sound like Jay-Z.\" You know, they dick riders. Whatever. So I'll play them these post-Blueprint beats or whatever and then I'll play my shit. I'll be like, \"yo but I rap too.\" Hey, I guess they was lookin' at me crazy cause you know, cause I ain't have a jersey on or whatever. Everybody out there listen here: I played them 'Jesus Walks' and they didn't sign me. You know what happened, it was some A&R's that fucked with me though, but then like the heads, it'd be somebody at the company that'll say \"naw.\" Like, Dave Lighty fucked with me, my nigga Mel brought me to a bunch of labels. Jessica Rivera, man...\n\n"], "\"Man, you niggas is stupid if y'all don't sign Kanye, for real.\"": ["\n\nI'm not gonna say nothin to mess my promotion up\n\n"], "\"We gonna change the game, buddy.\"": ["\n\nDame was like, \"Yo you got a deal with Capitol? Okay man, just make sure it's not wack.\"\n\n"], "\"You gotta make sure it's not wack.\"": ["\n\nThen one day I just went ahead and played it, I wanted to play some songs, cause you know Cam was in the room, Young Guru, and Dame was in the room. So I played... actually it's a song that you'll never hear, but maybe I might use it. So, it's called 'Wow.'\nI go to Jacob with 25 thou, you go with 25 hundred, wow\nI got eleven plaques on my walls right now\nYou got your first gold single, damn, nigga, wow.\"Like the chorus went. Don't bite that chorus, I might still use it. So I play that song for him and he's like \"oh shit\"\n\n"], "\"Oh shit it's not even wack.\"": ["\n\n\"I ain't gonna front, it's kinda hot.\"\n\n"], "\"it's actually kinda hot.\"": ["\n\nLike they still weren't looking at me like a rapper. And I'm sure Dame figured, 'like man. If he do a whole album, if his raps is wack at least we can throw Cam on every song and save the album, you know. So uh Dame took me into the office, and he's like \"yo man, B, B, you don't want a brick, you don't want a brick\"\n\n"], "\"you don't wanna catch a brick\"": ["\n\n\"You gotta be under an umbrella, you'll get rained on.\" I told Hiphop and Hiphop was all, \"oh, word?\" Actually, even with that I was still about to take the deal with Capitol cause it was already on the table and cause of my relationship with 3H. That, you know, cause I told him I was gonna do it, and I'm a man of my word, I was gonna roll with what I said I was gonna do. Then, you know, I'm not gonna name no names, but people told me, \"oh he's just a producer rapper,\" and told 3H that told the heads of the Capitol, and right-- the day I'm talking about, I planned out everything I was gonna do. Man, I had picked out clothes, I already started booking studio sessions, I started arranging my album, thinking of marketing schemes, man I was ready to go. And they had Mel call me, they said, \"yo... Capitol pulled on the deal\"\n\n"], "\"Yo, Capitol pulled out on the deal.\"": ["", "\n\n\n\nAnd, you know I told them that Roc-A-Fella was interested and I don't know if they thought that was just something I was saying to gas them up to try to push the price up or whatever. I went up... I called G, I said, \"man, you think we could still get that deal with Roc-A-Fella?\"\n\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\nSo won't you raise your glass, won't you...\n\n"], "Quavo": ["\n(Quavo!)\nLifestyle on camera\nHundred thousand dollar chandelier\nThey tried to turn me to an animal\nBut white people think I'm radical\nSupermodels think I'm handsome\nYou might think I'm too aggressive\nBut really I think I'm too passive\n'Til I pull out the chopper, start blastin'\n\n"], "Gucci Mane": ["\nIt's Gucci!\nFresh out the feds in this mothafucka\nAnd they still ain't ready yet for a mothafucka\nGucci Mane and I'm 'bout to put my Yeezys on\nNow that Gucci home, it's over for you Gucci clones\n\n", "\nShe say she don't want a chump, baby want a champ\nShe say money make her cum, Gucci make her damp\n1017's the Squad, Gucci Mane's the stamp\nAnd he don't never sleep, he's a fuckin' vamp\nI heard your bitch ride on the bus, you don't give a damn\nMy bitch drive a Lamb', you should call her ma'am\nI love my Auntie Jane, but fuck Uncle Sam\nI'm a walkin' money machine, check my Instagram\nNiggas never test the kid so I don't have to cram\nMy city treat me like a king, I should wear a crown\nAnd I don't really fuck around\nI gave my bitch two mil' 'cause she stuck around\n\n"], "Travis Scott + Desiigner": ["\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\n\n", "\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\nChampions, we run the city\nNumber one, they fallin' from the top\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\n\n", "", "\n\n\n1500, all in singles (straight up!)\nThrow it up, watch it fall and drop\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go, 'round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\nChampions, we run the city\nNumber one, they fallin' from the top\n'Round and 'round they go\n'Round and 'round it go\n'Round and 'round they go\nI'd rather be strapped and ride with a pole\nThan to get down in a hole\n\n"], "Yo Gotti": ["\nI'm Yo Gotti!\nReach for my chain is suicide\nThe car I drive fit two inside\nThey mad at Ye 'cause he all in the neighborhood\nBut he let them goons inside\nLet's fuck up the neighborhood\nLet's fuck up the neighborhood\nBuy every house in this bitch\nYou know that the money good\nMy wrist in the kitchen go 'round and 'round\nPlay with the kid, I'ma gun you down\nThe roof on that Wraith in the lost and found\nOfficial trap shit let me slow it down\nWay more shit than a Pamper\nAll we rock is bandanas\nWhips so nasty, no manners\nI just got head in a Phantom\n\n"], "Beenie Man": ["\nRelivin' the past?\nYour loss!\n\n", "", "\n\n\nMemories don't live like people do\nThey always 'member you\nWhether things are good or bad\nIt's just the memories that you have\nMemories don't live like people do\nThey always 'member you\nWhether things are good or bad\nIt's just the memories that you have\n\n"], "King Louie": ["\nRockstar bitch call me Elvis\nM.O.B, she call me selfish\nSuccess got 'em jealous\nShorty's killin', while I'm drillin'\nTattoos, how they break the news\nIt was real if you made the news\nLast night my bitches came in twos\nAnd they both sucked like they came to lose\nDropped out the first day of school\nCause niggas got cocaine to move\nI be goin' hard, I got a name to prove\nKillin' 'em, honey how I make the pain improve\n\n", "\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\n\n", "\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\nWe can send this bitch up, it can go down\n\n"], "Tyler, The Creator": ["\nFor your boy\nI'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor\nI'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga\n\n", "\nMoney, money, money, money\nMoney ain't the motive\nWhat's your name again?
